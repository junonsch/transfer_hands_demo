## Load project / data
### Clone project and load data

Please clone the repository: https://github.com/junonsch/transfer_hands_demo.git
In it, you will find the trained models in .pt format and loss and accuracy values in pickle format. 
Furthermore, there ist all the background code needed.

The dataset used in this project is the 11k Hands dataset that can be found here: https://sites.google.com/view/11khands. Please download the data into an appropriate folder in the project directory.  
The HandInfo.csv should be put here: data/hands/HandInfo.csv  
The data should be put in a folder with this path: data/hands/Hands/Hands/  

#TODO:
- delete unnecessary folders
- delete files: resnet_fine, ... -> can we keep just one file of each?
